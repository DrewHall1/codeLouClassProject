LFC Supporter Site

# Project Title

One Paragraph of project description goes here - I decided to do this site as I noticed that a group I follow on Facebook, a local supporter group that support the English football (soccer) club Liverpool FC, had a twitter page and Facebook page, but no website.  They needed a site and I needed a project, so it was win-win.  
I contacted the local club president to ask permission and he sent me some photos along with what he'd like to see on the site.  This is just the beginning of what I hope to become an actual live site for them that I can add more functionality to during one of the back-end sessions.  There is a lot more that I'd like to do with this but building it has been fun, frustrating, overwhelming at times, but also very exciting.  
The navigation bar will eventually link to other items/pages requested by the "client".
